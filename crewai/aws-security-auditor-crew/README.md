# AWS Infrastructure Security Audit And Reporting Crew

Welcome to the AWS Infrastructure Security Audit And Reporting Crew project, powered by [CrewAI](https://crewai.com). This project is designed to help you perform security audits and generate reports for your AWS infrastructure using a multi-agent AI system, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by CrewAI.

## Get Started

### Python Version Requirements

CrewAI requires Python >=3.10 and <=3.12. Here's how to check your version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you need to update Python, visit [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)

### Installing CrewAI

1. Install CrewAI with all recommended tools using either method:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```
or
```bash
pip install crewai crewai-tools
```

2. For existing installations, upgrade CrewAI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade crewai crewai-tools
```

If you see a Poetry-related warning, migrate to the new dependency manager:
```bash
crewai update
```

3. Verify your installation:

```bash
pip freeze | grep crewai
```

### Project Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `.env` file
3. Install project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Customizing
### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following required variables:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION_NAME=your_aws_region
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key
MODEL=bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
```

### Configuration Files
- Modify `src/aws_infrastructure_security_audit_and_reporting/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/aws_infrastructure_security_audit_and_reporting/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/aws_infrastructure_security_audit_and_reporting/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/aws_infrastructure_security_audit_and_reporting/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To start your crew of AI agents and begin the AWS security audit, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
crewai run
```

This command initializes the AWS Infrastructure Security Audit crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The AWS Infrastructure Security Audit crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to perform security audits and generate comprehensive reports. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
