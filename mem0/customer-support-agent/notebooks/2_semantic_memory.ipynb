    "# Semantic Memory in Customer Support: Insurance Domain Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how **Semantic Memory** can be used in customer support agents to learn and apply domain knowledge across different customer interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept: Knowledge Emerges from Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional knowledge bases that require manual curation, semantic memory automatically extracts and stores general concepts, principles, and domain expertise from real customer conversations. When a new customer asks about a similar topic, the agent can apply this learned knowledge to provide accurate, consistent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Cross-Customer Learning**: Knowledge from one interaction helps all future customers\n",
    "- **Consistent Expertise**: All agents apply the same domain principles  \n",
    "- **Automatic Knowledge Building**: No manual knowledge base maintenance required\n",
    "- **Conceptual Understanding**: Agents understand underlying principles, not just specific cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows how an insurance support agent learns tree damage liability principles from one conversation and applies them to help different customers with similar scenarios."
