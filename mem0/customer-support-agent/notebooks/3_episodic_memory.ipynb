    "# Episodic Memory in Customer Support: Personalized Service Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how **Episodic Memory** creates deeply personalized customer experiences by remembering each customer's unique history, circumstances, and past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept: Every Customer Has a Unique Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Episodic memory ensures that specific customer events, circumstances, and history are remembered across all interactions. Unlike semantic memory which stores general knowledge, episodic memory is personal - it remembers that John's mother has medical equipment, that Sarah's son just got his license, or that Michael had a traumatic water damage experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Personal Recognition**: Customers feel valued when agents remember their specific situations\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Service**: Responses account for past events and customer circumstances  \n",
    "- **Relationship Building**: Each interaction builds on the customer's unique journey\n",
    "- **Proactive Support**: Agents can anticipate needs based on customer history\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows how an insurance agent remembers a customer's previous water damage crisis involving medical equipment and provides personalized service months later when they call about a new issue."
